🎨 Palettea

Palettea is an open creative software project that brings Procreate-level brush simulation to every platform, not just iPad.

It’s built for artists, designers, and developers who value real craftsmanship, creative freedom, and beauty without compromise.

🌿 Overview

Palettea is designed to deliver natural, painterly brush behavior that rivals Procreate — with a focus on realism, responsiveness, and cross-platform compatibility.

Unlike closed or hype-driven ecosystems, Palettea is being built as a community-driven, open creative tool where quality and authenticity come first.

⚙️ Core Features & Goals

🖌 Procreate-Style Brush Simulation

Realistic pressure, tilt, and texture behavior

Smooth blending and color mixing

Responsive stroke performance with low latency

💻 Cross-Platform Support
Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android — bringing advanced brush tools to every creative setup.

🎨 Creative Freedom
No subscriptions, no gimmicks. Just an artist-first tool for real painting, sketching, and design.

🧠 Real-Time Rendering
Built for GPU-accelerated performance and expressive mark-making.

🌍 Open Collaboration
Developed by volunteers and artists who care about restoring artistic integrity in digital creation.

🧩 Current Status

Currently in prototype and research phase.

We are developing early tests of the brush engine — focusing on stroke blending, smudge realism, and pressure response.

Volunteer contributors are welcome to join, especially those experienced in:

Brush simulation, GPU shaders, or WebGL

Cross-platform UI frameworks (React Native, Flutter, or custom engines)

Digital art UX design and testing

👩‍💻 Contributing

Palettea is not a startup factory project — it’s a craft-driven collaboration.

We’re looking for developers and artists who believe in building something real, not rushing to please investors.

How to Join:

Send a brief note about your skills and motivation.

Complete a test project replicating brush simulation (focus: realism, responsiveness, and blending).

Share your demo links or code samples.

Schedule a short Google Meet or Zoom chat to discuss collaboration and next steps.

📜 Guiding Values

Art over algorithms — creativity leads, code follows.

Truth over trends — no hype, no fads.

Freedom over control — open access, open collaboration.

Beauty as resistance — a response to the cultural war on craftsmanship.

Open source license to be determined (likely MIT or AGPL once the core codebase stabilizes).

⚡ Vision

Palettea exists to restore artistry to digital creation — giving painters, illustrators, and designers a brush engine that finally feels alive again.

A cross-platform tool, built with heart, not hype.


“Real art tools for real artists.”
